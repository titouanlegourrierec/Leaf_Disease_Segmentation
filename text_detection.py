    Sort a list of detections based on the average y-coordinate of each detection's bounding box. 
    The average y-coordinate is calculated as the mean of the y-coordinate of the top-left and 
    the bottom-right corners of the bounding box. The list is sorted in ascending order, 
    meaning detections higher in the image (with a smaller y-coordinate) will appear before 
    detections lower in the image.

    Parameters:
        - detections (list): A list of detections. Each detection is a tuple where the first element 
                       is a list of bounding box coordinates, the second element is the detected 
                       text, and the third element is the confidence score.

    Returns:

    Note:
    The bounding box coordinates are expected to be in the format [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]
